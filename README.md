I developed this spotify clone using MEAN stack and oAuth 2.0. At this point you'll have to inspect the page and view it in 
mobile, or from a mobile device. So far I have the general skeleton outlined. As of now I have the login, search and playlists
functions working. To be able to use this application you'll need to click the hamburger menu, click login and approve the application to access your account. After that feel free to browse the search function, as of now it only searches artist names. however you can click albums and playlists to view songs within. Click your library, click playlists and your playlists will populate the screen! you can then click on any song you want to play and it will play a 30 second clip.
